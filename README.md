CS-210 8-1 Journal: Portfolio

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project I created a program for a bank by the name of Airgead Banking. I was tasked to develop an application that helps highschool students become fiscally responsible by how their investments and savings will grow over time. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well by implementing the object oriented programming principles as well as implement a user menu to help the user navigate the program easily.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If feel as if I used functions and procedures I would've made the code somewhat better as it makes the code more readable and can be called within other functions making the program even powerful.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What If found most challenging was when I was implementing the code for year end interests and balances. I overcame this by implementing a stringstream. For future reference I plan on reading more about c++ as well as use w3schools.com as resources.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill that I find to be tranferable is the use and understanding of OOP Principles. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using identifiers as well as using the right methods.
